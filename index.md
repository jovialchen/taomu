## About Me 🌟

✨ **Gemini / Former ENFP → Current ENTJ (What happened? 🤔) / Proud Ravenclaw Alumni** ✨

🎓 **Tech Enthusiast / Telecom Engineer / C & C++ Developer / Machine Learning Aficionado**

🌟 Hello there! I'm a curious soul with a dynamic blend of creativity and logic. I started my journey as an ENFP, wandering through the world with endless ideas and enthusiasm, and somehow evolved into an ENTJ — maybe the tech world shaped me more than I realized!

🔧 During the day, you'll find me diving into the realms of **machine learning** and **telecom engineering**, crafting code in **C & C++**. By night, I'm an avid gamer, building my dream island in *Animal Crossing* 🏝️ or getting lost in the historical charms of *江南百景图* 🏯.
